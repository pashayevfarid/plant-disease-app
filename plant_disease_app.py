    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! 
    
    Our goal is to assist in the early identification of plant diseases, enabling you to take swift action to protect your crops and ensure a healthier harvest.
                
    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Navigate to the **Disease Recognition** page and either upload an image  of a plant or capture one directly using your camera (coming soon).
    2. **Analysis:** Our advanced deep learning model processes the image to detect signs of diseases based on trained algorithms.
    3. **Results:** Once the analysis is complete, youâ€™ll see the predicted disease along with its symptoms and recommended treatment.
                
    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and begin identifying plant diseases efficiently.
