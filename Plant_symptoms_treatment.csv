Disease,Symptoms,Treatment
Apple_scab,"Small olive-coloured areas appear on young leaves, later turn black, and may coalesce. Black circular spots appear on fruit.",Occurs almost everywhere apples are grown. Infection reduces fruit size and quality.
Apple___Black_rot,"Leaf lesions start as very small purple spots. As they grow larger, there is a brownish-tan center with darker margins and a purple outline that resemble a frog’s eye. Symptoms on the fruit appear at the calyx end as brown/rotted lesions. As the lesions enlarge, they form a number of concentric rings ","Remove mummified fruit, dead trees, dead or dying infected limbs. Prune out cankersto greatly reduce the amount of available inoculum."
Apple___Cedar_apple_rust,"On apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.","Choose resistant cultivars when available. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host.Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely"
Apple___healthy,,
Cherry_(including_sour)___healthy,,
Cherry_(including_sour)___Powdery_mildew,"Initial symptoms, often occurring 7 to 10 days after the onset of the first irrigation, are light roughly-circular, powdery looking patches on young, susceptible leaves (newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves).  ","Pruning. Humid conditions favor cherry powdery mildew. A well pruned canopy will promote more air flow and leaf drying, reducing these humid conditions favorable for disease. Pruning will also help to achieve good spray coverage."
Corn_(maize)___Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot,"Symptoms of gray leaf spot are usually first noticed in the lower leaves. Initially, lesions of gray leaf spot begin as a small dot with a yellow halo. Lesions will elongate over time running parallel to the veins becoming pale brown to gray and rectangular in shape with blunt ends.","No biological control is available to control this disease. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Foliar fungicide treatment is a way to manage the disease if it occurs at early stages but it has to be weighted against the weather conditions, the potential yield loss and the susceptibility of the plant. Fungicides containing pyraclostrobin and strobilurin, or combinations of azoxystrobin and propiconazole, prothioconazole and trifloxystrobin work well to control the fungus."
Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_,"Common rust produces rust-colored to dark brown, elongated pustules on both leaf surfaces. The pustules contain rust spores that are cinnamon brown in color. Pustules darken as they age. Leaves, as well as sheaths, can be infected. ",Cultural control of Rust disease in Maize: Remove the alternate hosts. Collect the remains of the crop and destroy by burning or burying. 
Corn_(maize)___healthy,,
Corn_(maize)___Northern_Leaf_Blight,"Typical symptoms of northern corn leaf blight are canoe-shaped lesions 1 inch to 6 inches long. The lesions are initially bordered by gray-green margins. They eventually turn tan colored and may contain dark areas of fungal sporulation. Lesions begin on the lower leaves and then spread to upper leaves. Severe symptoms can progress rapidly, resulting in blighted leaves.","Ways to change cropping practices to control the disease include reducing the amount of infected residue left in a field, managing weeds to improve airflow and reduce humidity, and encouraging residue decomposition with tillage. If possible, planting in low areas that receive heavy dew and fog should be avoided. A combination of crop rotation for one to two years followed by tillage is recommended to prevent NCLB disease development.
"
Grape___Black_rot,"Disease development is favored by warm and humid weather. Symptoms of black rot first appear as small yellow spots on leaves. Enlarged spots have a dark brownish-red border with tan to dark brown centers. As the infection develops, tiny black dots appear in the lesion, usually in a ring pattern near the border of the lesion. Lesions on shoots, cluster stems, rachises and tendrils are oval shaped and sunken with a purple to black color. ","Sanitation plays an important part in limiting the amount of black rot inoculum found in a vineyard. If only a few leaf lesions appear in the spring, these should be removed. The removal of diseased tendrils and canes through pruning during the dormant season will reduce the amount of spores available to cause infections in the spring."
Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles),"The main symptom is an interveinal ""striping"" on the leaves, which is characterized by the discoloration and drying of the tissues around the main veins. It usually shows as dark red in red varieties and yellow in white ones. Leaves can dry out completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round, dark spots, often bordered by a brown- purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening. In severely affected vines, the berries often crack and dry.","Soak dormant cuttings for 30 mins in hot water at about 50°C. This treatment is not always effective and must therefore be combined with other methods. Some species of Trichoderma have been used to prevent the infection of pruning wounds, basal ends of propagation material, and graft unions. This treatment has to be carried out within 24 hours of pruning and again 2 weeks after."
Grape___healthy,,
Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot),"The disease is characterized by large, irregular shaped spots, which are initially dull red to brown in color but turn black and brittle with age.",Collecting and burning the infected plant parts minimizes the spread of the disease. Streptocycline (500 ppm) is very effective as a prophylactic spray. Weekly sprays of copper fungicide and Bordeaux mixture given from last week of October are effective to prevent the incidence and spread of the disease.
Peach___Bacterial_spot,"Symptoms of bacterial spot are first noticed in the leaves. Symptoms begin as small, water-soaked lesions that become larger and turn reddish brown or black over time. The growth of lesions is restricted by the leaf veins giving them an angular appearance. As the disease progresses, the lesions often fall away from the leaves giving them a ragged appearance. Leaves turn yellow and eventually fall from the tree. ","Timely pruning practices used by commercial growers and homeowners facilitate controlling diseases like bacterial spot. Early season pruning can help control tree vigor, and summer pruning can improve air movement and increase sunlight penetration to improve fruit ripening."
Peach___healthy,,
Pepper_bell___Bacterial_spot,"On pepper, irregular spots enlarge, become reddishbrown or tan with dark margins, but centers do not fall out. Leaves become ragged as symptoms advance. Spotted leaves on pepper plants do not turn yellow. Leaves drop, defoliating plants and exposing fruit to sunscald injury.","Promptly destroy crops after the last harvest to stop bacteria from multiplying in and on plants left in abandoned fields.
Destroy spring crops before transplanting a fall crop on the same farm, so bacteria do not spread from one crop to the next.
Do not replant into plastic or organic mulch used for a previous crop."
Pepper_bell___healthy,,
Potato___Early_blight,"Spots begin as small, dark, dry, papery flecks, which grow to become brown-black, circular-to-oval areas. The spots are often bordered by veins that make them angular. The spots usually have a target appearance, caused by concentric rings of raised and depressed dead tissue. A yellowish or greenish-yellow ring is often seen bordering the growing spots. As the spots become very large, they often cause the entire leaf to become yellow and die.",Avoid overhead irrigation. Do not dig tubers until they are fully mature in order to prevent damage. Do not use a field for potatoes that was used for potatoes the previous year. Keep this year’s field at least 225 to 450 yards away from last year’s field. Surround the field with wheat to keep wind-blown spores from entering. Use adequate nitrogen levels and low phosphorus levels to reduce disease severity.

Potato___Late_blight,Water-soaked dark green to black or purplish lesions with pale green margins on lower leaves.White mildew at edge of lesions,responsible for Irish famine; caused starvation and death and mass migration of population
Strawberry___healthy,,
Strawberry___Leaf_scorch,"Symptoms of leaf scorch consist of numerous small, irregular, purplish spots or “blotches” that develop on the upper surface of leaves. The centers of the blotches become brownish. Blotches may coalesce until they nearly cover the leaflet, which then appears purplish to reddish to brown.","Remove the older and infected leaves from runner plants before setting. Take care in spacing runner plants in matted-row culture.
Plant in light, well-drained soil in a location exposed to all-day sun and good air circulation. Control weeds in the planting. Weeds reduce air circulation and increase drying time for leaves. Removing infected leaves after harvest (during renovation) is helpful in reducing inoculum and controlling all the leaf diseases."
Tomato___Bacterial_spot,"Tomato leaves have small, brown, circular spots surrounded by a yellow halo. The center of the leaf spots often falls out resulting in small holes. The leaf spots do not contain concentric rings.","Remove symptomatic plants from your garden or greenhouse to prevent the spread of bacteria to healthy plants. Burn (where allowed by local ordinance), bury or hot compost the affected plants, and DO NOT eat symptomatic fruit."
Tomato___Early_blight,"The appearance of circular or irregular dark spots on the lower, more mature leaves is one of the first symptoms of infection. Eventually, the spots enlarge into a series of concentric rings surrounded by a yellow area. The entire leaf may be killed and will drop off the plant. Early blight can result in extensive defoliation, exposing fruit to sunscald and reducing yields. This disease typically progresses from the base of the plant, upward.","Cover the soil under the plants with mulch, such as fabric, straw, plastic mulch, or dried leaves. Water at the base of each plant, using drip irrigation, a soaker hose, or careful hand watering. Increase airflow by staking or trellising, removing weeds, and spacing plants adequately apart. Pruning the bottom leaves can also prevent early blight spores from splashing up from the soil onto leaves. "
Tomato___healthy,,
Tomato___Late_blight,"Symptoms of late blight may be found on any above-ground part of the tomato plant. Infected leaves typically have green to brown patches of dead tissue surrounded by a pale green or gray border. When the weather is very humid and wet, late blight infections can appear water-soaked or dark brown in color, and are often described as appearing greasy. Symptomatic tomato fruits appear mottled, often with golden to dark brown, firm, sunken surfaces. ","Strategies for managing late blight in tomato include planting resistant cultivars, eliminating volunteers (tomato plants that have re-seeded from the previous year’s crop), spacing plants to increase airflow and reduce humidity, and applying preventive and effective fungicides to avoid infection."
Tomato___Leaf_Mold,"Pale greenish-yellow spots, usually less than 1/4 inch, with no definite margins, form on the upper sides of leaves. Olive-green to brown velvety mold forms on the lower leaf surface below leaf spots. Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant.","Remove and destroy all affected plant parts. For plants growing under cover, increase ventilation and, if possible, the space between plants. Try to avoid wetting the leaves when watering plants, especially when watering in the evening, Copper-based fungicides can be used to control diseases on tomatoes."
Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,"The first symptoms appear as small, water-soaked, circular spots 1/16 to 1/8"" in diameter on the undersides of older leaves. The centers of these spots then turn gray to tan and have a dark-brown margin. The spots are distinctively circular and are often quite numerous.",Remove infected lower leaves to limit the spread to fruit-bearing branches. Then turn to effective treatments such as GardenTech® brand's Daconil® fungicides to protect healthy tissue.
Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite,"This injury produces tiny white or yellow spots, giving leaves and needles a stippled or mottled appearance. As feeding becomes more severe, plants look bronzed or bleached and leaves may drop.","Extension horticulturists currently recommend aiming a hard stream of water at infested plants to knock spider mites off the plants. Other options include insecticidal soaps, horticultural oils, or neem oil."
Tomato___Target_Spot,Target spot symptoms begin as small dark lesions which enlarges to form light brown lesions with concentric pattern and a yellow halo around it in the transplants. Lesions can be seen inside the canopy and the micro-climate favors the infection process.,"Warm wet conditions favour the disease such that fungicides are needed to give adequate control. The products to use are chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or mancozeb. Treatment should start when the first spots are seen and continue at 10-14-day intervals until 3-4 weeks before last harvest."
Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus,"The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas, the latter often appearing thicker and raised giving a blister-like appearance. The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted.","If you have any plants in your garden that you suspect may be infected, remove them immediately to prevent the spread of the virus. Infected plants should be uprooted entirely and burned. Infected plants often exhibit no visible signs of illness, therefore it’s important to frequently disinfect tools, ideally between each plant."
Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus,"Leaflets are rolled upwards and inwards. Leaves are often bent downwards, stiff, thicker than normal, have a leathery texture, show interveinal chlorosis and are wrinkled. Young leaves are slightly chlorotic (yellowish).","Inspect plants for whitefly infestations two times per week. If whiteflies are beginning to appear, spray with azadirachtin (Neem), pyrethrin or insecticidal soap. For more effective control, it is recommended that at least two of the above insecticides be rotated at each spraying."
